# Welcome

Welcome to experimental particle physics at the LHC. Over the next 7 weeks you will be doing different exercises using simulated or real data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC, colliding at an energy of 6.8 TeV per beam.

You can look forward to the following sessions:

(1) Tools, data and basic analysis concepts
(2) “Analysis: Invariant mass Z” : compute mass by hand - Pantelis
(3) Trigger turn-ons - Claire
(4) “Analysis: W, transverse mass” (with use of their trigger turn-on knowledge) -Pantelis (Claire away)
(5) 17th May: “Design your own trigger” - Claire
(6) 24th May: “Rediscover the Higgs (to 𝛾𝛾)” - Pantelis (Claire away)
(7) 31st May: “Rediscover the Higgs (to 𝛾𝛾)” with presentation? - Claire
